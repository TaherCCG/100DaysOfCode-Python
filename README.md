## What is Python?

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its readability and efficiency. Released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasises code readability, enabling programmers to express concepts with fewer lines of code compared to languages like C++ or Java. Its extensive libraries and frameworks, combined with an active community, make Python a popular choice for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
